Islandora Book Batch Rename Script
========================

Renames a folder full of TIFF/XML/MRC files and moves them into the correct folders to prepare for ingest using the Islandora Book Batch module

The batch renaming script needs the following setup to ensure it functions correctly:

 - A folder needs to be created containing all of the TIFF files for a single book and, optionally, an XML or MRC metadata file containing MODS, DC or MARCXML metadata as outlined above
 - The TIFF files in the folder need to be sequentially named, page to page, in alphabetical order, not numerical order.
   This means, importantly, that the files need to be listed, for example, as 001.tif, 002.tif, ... 009.tif, 010.tif, and NOT as 1.tif, 2.tif, ... 9.tif, 10.tif. In the former case, pages would be sorted correctly, whereas in the latter, pages would be sorted as 1, 10, 2, ... 9
 - A copy of rename_script.bat needs to be pasted into the folder and then run

The script will ask for the name of the book. This will become the folder name that all the pages will be placed in

After the batch script creates the folder, the folder itself will need to be moved to a .zip file. Each subsequent book created with the batch renaming script may be placed in the same .zip file.

Recommended Method
========================

Create a folder to copy or scan all your TIFF files into. Place rename_script.bat into it.

Copy or scan a full book into the folder with sequentially named TIFFs. Run the batch script. Optionally, copy a MODS XML file into the base folder that the batch script creates.

Copy or scan the next book into the same folder the first book was copied or scanned into. Run the same batch script. Continue for each subsequent book.

Create a new .zip file in the folder with the batch script. Copy all of the book folders into that .zip file.
